# Credict the sample size

## Need to know

- $X$, $Y$ refers the random variable.

- $E(X)$ refers the expection of $X$.

- $D(X)$ refers the derivation of $X$,  
  or barely use $\sigma^2$ if is not confused.

- $\bar{X}$ refers the sample mean of $X$,  
  $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N{X_i}$

- The sample derivation uses $s^2$,  
  $s^2 = \frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N{(X_i-\bar{X})^2}$
